Good morning,

It’s about 8:30am on Tuesday Feb 25th.

I will only spend 2 hours on this project. The initial commit will contain this INIT.txt and the commit will mark the start time. 

I’m going to start by documenting requirements. Then I will create time boxes for checkpoints.

AI tools
- Cursor
- Claude
- I use AI for bulk edits, generating scaffolding, and autocomplete. 
- I've tried composer but it's a little messy right now. Even with a good design doc.

Architecture
- Monorepo using Docker Compose
- FastAPI backend
- Next.js frontend
- LangChain and LLM (I’ll use OpenAI)
- Next.js calls the FastAPI backend directly
- Postgres database (if time allows)

Requirements
- Monorepo 
	- Dockerfiles for each package
	- Docker Compose to orchestrate them
	- Add dev tools to Docker Compose
	- Build and run instructions

- FastAPI Backend
	- LangChain and LLM (I’ll use OpenAI)
	- Endpoints with appropriate response statuses
	- Code formatting with black
	- Describe auth
	- Describe deployment

- Next.js Frontend
	- Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn
	- Call the backend and stream the response
	- Structure the app well

- Design Choices & AI
	- What tools did I use?
	- Framework, API choices, frontend state management
	- Timeboxing explanation

Timeboxes
- First Hour (8:30am - 9:30am)
	- 10 mins planning the project
		- Basic architecture
		- Defining the problem
	- 15 mins setting up the project and completing hello world
		- All services start
		- Frontend can call the backend
		- Frontend renders a button
		- Button click streams a response from the backend
		- I do all of these by hand rather than using AI because AI generates the files, it doesn't run the install commands.
	- 35 mins creating the chat interface and making the request to OpenAI
		- Stream a hardcoded OpenAI request from the backend
		- Build the frontend UI for chat interface

UPDATE - I'm a little past the first hour. I have the chat interface working. The resopnse is being streamed from the backend.
- I need to spend some time on edge cases and UI

- Second Hour (9:30am - 10:30am)
	- 40 mins polishing the UI and fixing edge cases
	- 20 mins on running from nothing

	- we'll see how much time I have left
	- might create the user login
	- might save each chat to the database
	- polish and readme
